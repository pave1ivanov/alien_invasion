# Alien Invasion

In this simple alien invasion game, the user controls a ship at the bottom of the screen.

The objective of the game is to defend the ship from incoming alien ships approaching from the top of the screen. 

The user controls the ship's movement horizontally with Arrow Keys and can shoot at the incoming alien ships using the Space button. 

The game ends if the alien ships reach the bottom of the screen or if the user's ship is hit by an alien ship's attack. 

The game can have various levels, and the difficulty increases as the player progresses through the levels.
